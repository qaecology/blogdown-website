Elliot Gould is a PhD candidate at the School of BioSciences, and a Quantitative Research Assistant on the repliCATS project at the School of BioSciences, University of Melbourne. Their PhD investigates the transparency and reproducibility of ecological models in applied ecology and conservation decision-making. Elliot seeks to use data science techniques to advance the open-science movement by improving the transparency and reproducibility within their home discipline of ecology and conservation science. Within this field, Elliot's primary interest is in building ecological models for aiding ecological management and conservation decisions. Other research interests include decision-theory, Structured Decision Making, and plant ecology (especially grasslands of the Victorian Volcanic Plains). They have an enthusiasm for teaching and skill-sharing, particularly with regard to building a strong community of practice in emerging open-science methodology and computational biology within ecology and conservation.
