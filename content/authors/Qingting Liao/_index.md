Qingting is a PhD candidate supervised by Brendan Wintle and Billy Geary. Her research focuses on spatialising business impacts on biodiversity by integrating Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) with ecological modelling approaches.
Qingting has interdisciplinary training across land resource management, data science, and conservation, and previously worked on urbanisation’s impacts on North China leopard conservation using both social and ecological perspectives. She is particularly interested in applying integrative modelling approaches to link human activities with biodiversity outcomes, supporting conservation planning, corporate biodiversity assessment, and environmental policy development.
