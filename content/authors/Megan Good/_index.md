Megan is a post-doctoral research fellow working on woodland restoration and eucalypt dynamics across southern Australia. She is particularly interested in patterns of eucalypt regeneration and mortality in agricultural landscapes and the use of State-Transition models to guide management decisions for threatened woodland communities.
