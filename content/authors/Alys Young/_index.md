Alys was a PhD candidate at Deakin University in the Conservation Science lab led by Prof Emily Nicholson. Working with the Tiwi people and Land Council on the Tiwi Islands, Alys investigates ecosystem and biodiversity modelling, particularly using remote sensing and quantitative tools. More generally, she is interested in data analysis, modelling, and coding. She is also a Research Assistant undertaking data management, visualisation and developing shiny apps at The University of Melbourne, and previously at CSIRO. After her PhD, she joined the Global Ecology Lab at James Cook University as a postdoctoral research fellow with Prof Nicholas Murray.
