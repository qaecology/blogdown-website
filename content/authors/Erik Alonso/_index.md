Erik is a PhD student with Emma Hudgins as his primary supervisor. His research is based around biosecurity for the edible insect industry. The project aims to develop guidelines for best practice at the rearing and transport stages and develop spread models to understand risk areas.

Erik completed his undergraduate studies in Natural Resources Conservation at the University of British Columbia and has several years of experience as a GIS analyst in Fire and Biodiversity for Victorian government agencies. He has a deep interest in developing spatial tools and datasets to help inform decision making.
