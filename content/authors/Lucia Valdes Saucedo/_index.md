My name is Lucia Valdes Saucedo, I am a PhD student at QAEco, University of Melbourne. During my Masters, I worked with community ecology and functional diversity in coral reefs. My main interests are statistics and mathematical modelling. I enjoy learning from other fields, so I also have basic knowledge of medicine, immunology, ethology, veterinary medicine, sexology, psychology, and other random areas. As part of my PhD, I am currently working with Emma and Mick to train a deep learning model to detect invasive species (plants) and estimate which visual features are most important for their detectability.

My tastes are very varied, but in general, I enjoy anime, manga, reading, walking with my dog (Duke), BTS, and documentaries.
