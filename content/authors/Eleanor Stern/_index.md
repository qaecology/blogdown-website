Eleanor is a PhD Candidate at the University of Melbourne supervised by Mick McCarthy, Peter Vesk, and Chris Clements. Currently, she works in experimental ecology, using laboratory microcosms to test performance of SDMs in non-equilibrium conditions. Previously, she recieved her MSc from McGill University in Canada where she interwove scientific data and Indigenous knowledge into a mixed-methods moose habitat analysis. She recieved her BSc from the University of Alberta where she did research in the fields of geophysics, ecology, and wildlife epidemiology.
