Alyson Stobo-Wilson has a PhD in Ecology from Charles Darwin University. Alyson is currently a Postdoctoral Fellow for CSIRO, Land and Water, using large datasets and advanced remote sensing technologies to map biodiversity in northern Australia's tropical savanna and generate biodiversity indicators. Alyson's research to date has contributed to our understanding of drivers of small mammal decline in northern Australia, and more broadly the role of introduced predators in the decline of Australia's native fauna.
