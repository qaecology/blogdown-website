Esti is a plant ecologist interested in the mechanisms driving community assembly and species coexistence, with a special fascination with biological invasions and the role of functional traits in population and community dynamics. Her research combines a strong theoretical background, a functional perspective on ecological processes and advanced analytical methods and quantitative skills. 
Esti is motivated by the need to inform pressing conservation issues, including but not restricted to the management of biological invasions, and enjoys collaborating with local governments to develop tools and solutions that support biodiversity conservation.
