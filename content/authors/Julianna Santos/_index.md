Julianna is a research fellow working on improving methods to facilitate and support the implementation of the Red List of Ecosystems (RLE) globally and evaluate the roles of the RLE across targets of the Kumming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework. 

Julianna has always been interested in untangling processes and mechanisms driving biodiversity responses to environmental changes to inform conservation management. Originally from Brazil, she first started working with the population dynamics of Neotropical mammals. In her PhD at the University of Melbourne, Julianna combined conceptual frameworks and empirical modelling to investigate how fire regimes influence animal populations.
