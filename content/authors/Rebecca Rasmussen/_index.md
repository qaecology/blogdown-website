Rebecca Rasmussen is a PhD student supervised by Bronwyn Hradsky, Naomi Davis and Nic Geard. Her research explores agent-based modelling of invasive predators and their native Australian prey, and the technique's usefulness to both ecology and management. The goal of this research is to support land managers in making more informed decisions about invasive predator control to relieve predation pressure on threatened Australian fauna. Rebecca has an interdisciplinary background, with training in both mathematics and ecology. She has previously worked on topics such as hydrodynamical models of water bugs and compartmental models of infectious diseases.
