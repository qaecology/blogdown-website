David is a quantitative and spatial ecologist specialising in global change ecology. He is interested in the processes that drive species range changes under human-induced global change. He is currently investigating how to generate more reliable predictions of biodiversity redistribution under future global change scenarios to better inform conservation decision-making. 

Other research interests include disequilibrium in range dynamics under recent climatic change, emerging infectious diseases, monitoring global change effects on biodiversity, and spatial dynamics of biological invasions.
