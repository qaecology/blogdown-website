Emily is a research fellow developing a Victorian Biodiversity Index and spatial gap analysis with DEECA. She is particularly interested in applying ecological modelling methods to different ecological questions, including imperfect detection and site occupancy-detection models, environmental DNA sampling and large-scale sampling projects.
