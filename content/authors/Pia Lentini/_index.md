Pia is a Senior Scientist in Wildlife Ecology at the Arthur Rylah Institute for Environmental Research.

Pia's interests' span ecology, conservation and the social sciences. Her research explores human-wildlife coexistence and how our management decisions and behaviours are linked to conservation outcomes. She was a Senior Research Fellow with the ICON Science group at RMIT University, and an Honorary Fellow with QAECO. 

Whenever possible she works directly with decision makers and agency stakeholders, and although she loves all aspects of nature, she particularly enjoys working on questions related to bats. Pia also sits on the DELWP Scientific Advisory Committee and the Board of Wildlife Victoria.
