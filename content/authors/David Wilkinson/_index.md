David is a Research Fellow sitting across the QAEco and MetaMelb research labs. He works across a bunch of projects involving species distribution modelling, occupancy modelling, population viability analysis, and the replicability and reproducibility of published research. His own research focuses on joint species distribution models, and he collaborates on several SDM-based projects around the globe.
