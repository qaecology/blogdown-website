Ainslie holds degrees in Plant Science, Biological Anthropology, and Agricultural Science, and is currently a PhD candidate at the Melbourne Biodiversity Institute. Supervised by Professor Paul Cheng, Dr. Rachelle Meyer, and Dr. Rachel Morgain. Ainslie's research is focused on understanding the social and ecological value of dedicating agricultural land to biodiversity in Victoria from the perspective of farmers and native species. The goal of this research is to increase the land available to native species, whilst also creating beneficial outcomes for farmers and farm systems.
