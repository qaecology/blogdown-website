Ilham is a PhD Candidate under the supervision of Pete Vesk, Mick McCarthy, and Patrick Baker. His research focuses on investigating spatial arrangement of trees in a mixed Eucalypt forest in Victoria. He is interested in understanding how functional traits regulate habitat selection and interactions among trees which in turn influence forest spatial patterns.
Ilham completed his Bachelor in Forestry at Bogor Agricultural Institute - Indonesia and Master of Science in BioSciences at the University of Melbourne - Australia with QAECO group. He has ten years of experience working in the field of plant ecology as a research and conservation officer in a Botanic Garden in Indonesia before pursuing his PhD degree.
