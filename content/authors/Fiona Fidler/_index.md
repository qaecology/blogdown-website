Fiona has a joint appointment in the Schools of Ecosystem and Forestry Science, and Historical and Philosophical Studies. She is broadly interested in how experts, including scientists, make decisions and change their minds. She develops methods for eliciting reliable expert judgements to improve decision making. She also has an abiding interest in statistical controversies, and in how methodological change occurs in different disciplines, including psychology, medicine and ecology. Fiona is an ARC Future Fellow, and currently leads the repliCATS project. She was the founding president of the Association for Interdisciplinary Meta-research & Open Science (AIMOS) in 2019.
