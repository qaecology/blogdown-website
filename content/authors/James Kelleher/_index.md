Saoirse Kelleher is a PhD student studying the performance of correlative and mechanistic species distribution models using simulated testing systems. She is also interested in conservation technology and remote sensing, particularly for non-invasive wildlife monitoring and efficient data collection. Saoirse has previously worked on projects involving bat-mosquito interactions, sound pollution in national parks, and crustacean signaling pathways.
