Luca previously completed a Bachelor of Science with a major in Physics at the University of Melbourne. He is now working with supervisors Dr. Billy Geary and Dr. Emma Hudgins to complete a research project as part of the Master of Environment course. Luca's research is focused on assessing the threat posed to threatened forest mammals of Australia by high-risk forest pests through spread modelling and trait-based analyses.
