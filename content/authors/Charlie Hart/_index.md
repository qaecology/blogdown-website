Charlie is a Research Assistant working with Dr. Billy Geary on a project examining how species traits influence susceptibility to future fire regimes. Previously, Charlie worked with the FLARE Fire Ecology Research Group, where he investigated the effects of prescribed burning on wildfire severity using machine learning and remote sensing techniques.

He holds an MSc in Ecology, Evolution, and Conservation from Imperial College London, where he specialised in spatial analysis and ecological modelling.

Charlie has a broad background in ecological research, with experience spanning wildfire ecology, species distribution modelling, and biodiversity monitoring. He is particularly interested in applying quantitative approaches to understand ecological processes and support conservation decision-making.
