Iris is an early-career plant ecologist and botanist whose research focuses on long-term vegetation dynamics, conservation of threatened species, and speciesâ€™ responses to global drivers of change. She holds a Bachelor of Biological Science (Ecology) and a Master of Science in alpine ecology from La Trobe University. She is currently undertaking a PhD aiming to integrate empirical models, field experiment data, demographic models, and long-term monitoring to better understand range dynamics in alpine ecosystems. Her research is supervised by Professor Peter Vesk, Dr. James Camac, Associate Professor John Morgan, and Professor Dick Williams.
