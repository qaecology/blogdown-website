K was a PhD student working on efficiency in wildlife monitoring methods. She is particularly interested in cost-efficient survey design and distance sampling. Her work can be applied in a variety of monitoring contexts (plant or animal surveys in various habitats) but she is particularly keen on forests with big trees.
